# Predicting house pricing in Denver, Colorado

I used a polinomycal linear regression model to predict house prices in Denver Colorado based on scraped data from Zillow.com.

So far I've found that the size, number of beds and baths, the year in which the house was built, the schools district ranking, and the parking and cooling facilities are significant when predicting the price of the house.

The graph shows the actual vs predicted value of the houses. It can be seen that there is further work to do regarding some underprediction the model is making.
