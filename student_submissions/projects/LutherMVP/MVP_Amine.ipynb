    "\n",
    "Using a sample of rentals listings, I tried to explain the rent as a function of the square meter surface.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure depicts the model (blue) plotted against the actual data points. The prediction interval is plotted in orange.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Amine_pics/regression.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This result suggests that the surface is a good predictor of the rent (R2=0.94), but the model tend to have an error of 2k â‚¬, which is huge!  \n",
    "\n",
    "To go further, we can focus on the rent per square meter and see how it varies with other available variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The price / m2's distribution seems to be significantly different from a district to another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Amine_pics/arrondissements.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The price / m2 tend to decrease when the number of rooms increases. However its variance seem to decrease when the number of rooms goes up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Amine_pics/Number of rooms.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I will try to explain the price / m2 using features related to the flat or its location in order to increase the precision of the estimation."
