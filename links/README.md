## Checking for Valid Links / Listing All Links in the `class_lectures` Directory

### Purpose
- Solving the problem of invalid links.  This will help do that with minimal input of time.
- Solving the problem of navigating through the repo. This will help do that with minimal input of time.

### Execution
There are two Python files which you will find helpful.

1.  `checklinks.py` (written by Taylan)
- this script will check all links within a Markdown file and list any invalid links
- there are instructions within this file

2.  `get_links.py` (written by Reshama)
- this script will produce the file `links_all.md` which lists all the files within the `class_lectures` folder.

3.  The above two scripts should be run every class morning after daily lecture files have been added to the repo. 

### Future Work
- write a script that goes through all Markdown files within the repository and checks for valid links
