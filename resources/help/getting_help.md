## Guidelines For Getting Help

The bootcamp is a ton of work with challenging material and tight deadlines, so feeling stressed and needing assistance 
from time to time is completely normal and expected! The instructors, TAs, and rest of the Metis staff are 
here to support you at every step of the way. 

To make sure we can do our best to help everyone and minimize stress, we want to lay out a few guidelines for how 
and when you should proactively seek help.

### On-site / during normal hours (9am-5pm)

1. **The 20 Minute Rule**: In general, you should be stuck on a problem for *at least* 20 minutes before you ask for help. 
Being stuck and figuring things out on your own is a critical part of the learning experience, and this is what life as
a working data scientist will be like. Learning how to interpret error messages and effectively search for solutions online
is arguably one of the most useful things you will do. 

> * Python error messages are sometimes long, ugly, and scary looking, but when you work through the traceback they are often
very informative. Your first instinct should be to carefully read error messages and see if they are telling you explicitly
what you need to do or what went wrong.

> * Google, stackoverflow, stackexchange, quora, etc. are all your friend. Odds are that if you're having a syntax problem or 
trying to figure out a specific way to accomplish something in pandas, someone has encountered that and asked about it before.
I can't tell you how many times I've googled something like "pandas rename specific columns" in order to quickly figure out
the syntax I need.

2. **Coming to instructors vs TAs**: You can use your judgement here and also see who's available, but one rough rule of thumb
is that if you're struggling with syntax/debugging you may want to ask TAs first, and come to instructors with more conceptual
or theoretical questions.

### Outside of normal hours

Never hesitate to reach out to us *on slack* (this will always be the preferred means of communication) for help outside of 
normal bootcamp hours, including over the weekend. We can't guarantee an immediate response but will do our best to monitor
slack and get back to you. A best practice is to message the entire instructional team so that we can get back to you
sooner and are all kept in the loop.

Do not feel bad or worry about interrupting our weekends! If we're unavailable we'll just wait to respond and won't be
inconvienced. Please do let us know if you've solved your problem in the meantime before a response.
