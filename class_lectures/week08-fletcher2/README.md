# Welcome to Week 8: "Recommenders & Deep Learning with Keras" 

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Welcome to supercool algorithm week : we will introduce you to recommender machines and deep learning applications! 


#### Technical Focus

As part of your interview preparation process, we will start this week with a general review (including a review of last week's quiz). We will learn about both collaboritive and content-based filtering recommender system methods and well as leverage your understanding of matrix decomposition for recommenders.  We will then learn how to work with Keras, a high-level neural net python library, to develop your own nets.  The rest of the week is for you & Luther -- good luck!
