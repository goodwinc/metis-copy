**This morning, for a change, we are going to do some puzzles. Take a little break from coding!**

*Do not google anything. In fact, just look at this page (and nothing else) on the computer and solve the problems/puzzles on paper. Also, don't call out the answers or Slack 'em this one time. I want everyone to have the chance to tackle these.*

**Problem 1:**

There are three of you in a room. I say, "In this hidden bag, I have three white hats and two black hats." I place a hat on each person's head. Everyone can see what's on the others' head but not what's on their own head. I ask the first person, "what color is your hat?" He looks at the other two and says, "I don't know." I ask the second person the same question and I get the same answer. It's your turn now. Can you tell me what's the color of your hat?

**Problem 2:**

A man lives on the 14th floor of an apartment. Every morning, when he goes to work, he gets on the elevator at the 14th floor and goes down to the lobby. In the evening, if he is on his own, he takes the elevator from the lobby to the 8th floor and then walks up 6 flights. But if there are other people, he goes straight to the 14th floor. And if it's a rainy day, he goes straight to the 14th floor. Why does he do that?

**Problem 3:**

Can you draw [this pattern](square.gif) without taking your hand off the paper? If so, how? If no, why not?

**Problem 4:**

Three kids visit their grandmother. The first kid sees a jar of candy. She counts the candy and makes three equal piles. There is one extra. So she eats the extra candy and also her share. And returns the rest to the jar. The second walks by the candy jar. Not knowing one of his cousins has gone through it, he too makes three equal piles, and there is one extra. He eats the extra one and his presumed share. Of the remaining candy, the third cousin does the same (again there is one extra, which is eaten along with a third). Later in the evening, the grandmother calls the three kids and takes out the candy jar. What's in the jar gets evenly split between the three. And this time it's perfect! How many candies were originally in the bottle?

**Problem 5:**

If I randomly choose three points on a circle, what's the probability that the triangle formed by those three points will include the center of the cirle? The center of the circle can be on or inside the triangle.
