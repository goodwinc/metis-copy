## Curse of Dimensionality

For this problem we will be exploring high dimensional spaces.

1. Let's start in two dimensions. Write a Monte-Carlo simulation that finds the area ratio between a square and it's inscribed circle. You should uniformly sample points between 1 and -1 for both x and y, and then test if the point is further than 1 from the origin. Approximately what is the ratio? keep sampling points until you are sure within 3 sig figs.

2. Re-write the simulation to work in 3 dimensions. What is the ratio between space inside a cube and a sphere?

3. Re-write the simulation to work in n dimensions. Plot the ratio for a bunch of different n's. 

4. Can you guess a formula to describe the ratio as a function of n. What are the implications of this on techniques that assume nearby points?
