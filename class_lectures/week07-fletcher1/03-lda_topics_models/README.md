 * [Topic Models (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model): This also has links to other main topic modeling algorithms:
     * Explicit semantic analysis (Using documents of another corpus as topics)
     * Latent semantic analysis  (PCA with Multinomial distribution, predecessor of LDA)
     * Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, the most popular one, what we went over today)
     * Hierarchical Dirichlet process (Hierarchical LDA)
     * Non-negative matrix factorization (A linear algebra based method)
 * [How does LDA work?](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/): This is a pretty good explanation, I really recommend reading it.
