#### Pair Problem

1) Write function that would do KMeans clustering: def KMeans(points,k)

While this is straightforward, it does involve doing a few steps. So I set you guys up with a [Jupyter Notebook](KMeans_pair.ipynb) if you want a head start. You just need to complete two functions that are left blank in there.

2) If you are done, try to vectorize the assignPoints() function. When you vectorize, you avoid using an explicit loop (like 'for').
