    "Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications in a reproducible fashion. The goal is to eliminate issues with different environments and software versions by using a fully reproducible environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished within Docker through what are known as containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box."

    "## But what *is* Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, **Docker is a bit like a virtual machine.** But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker **allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on** and only requires applications to be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Docker exclusively runs on the Linux kernel, installing it on Mac actually *does* require a Linux virtual machine to provide the basic environment."
