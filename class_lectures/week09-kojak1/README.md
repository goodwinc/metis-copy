# Welcome to Week 9: "Big Data Week"  

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Perhaps the fact that this is the last full week of instruction is a bittersweet one for you.
We will continue with Deep Learning. And you will learn how to work with very large data sets via Hadoop, Hive & Spark.


#### Technical Focus

We will start off the week by introducing your fifth and final project: Kojak.  You will learn about Docker, as well as how to  deploy Hadoop, Hive & spark via Docker on your EC2 instance with a few (relatively) quick steps.  We will discuss the Hadoopp & Map Reduce paradigm, and work some serious data crunching via Hadoop & hive.  Last, but certainly anything but least, we will work with Spark including all the cool machine learning libraries therein.
