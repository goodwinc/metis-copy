**10:30 am**: Intro to Time Series!

We have so much great material on time series that we won't be able to cover it all.  During the lecture we will be focusing on these three docs:
* [ARIMA Notebook](ARIMA.ipynb)
* [Intro to Time Series](Time_Series.pdf)
* [Even more about Time Series](Time_Series_Revisited.pdf)

But here are even more resources for you:
* [Code to follow "Intro to Time Series"](Time_Series_Forecasting_Autoregressive_Models.ipynb)
* [Cool Time Series tools in Python](Google_trends.ipynb) - fbprophet, pyflux
* Joe's [time series forecasting with neural networks work](https://github.com/JEddy92/TimeSeries_Seq2Seq)

**12:00 pm**: Lunch

**1:00 pm**: Investigation Presentation
