**Thought for the day:**     

Today, let us progress instead of regress, even when studying regression

**12:00 pm**: Breathe, enjoy the weather, eat, relax.  We'll pick back up just as hard in the afternoon.

**1:00 pm**: Investigation Presentation

**1:15 pm**: Optional Review Session: Python

**2:15 pm**: Free Time, work on:
* Project Luther (scraping first). Please submit a draft project proposal to us telling us about the website you plan to scrape by the end of the day today.
