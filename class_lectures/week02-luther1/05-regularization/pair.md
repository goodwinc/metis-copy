## Pair Problem (Using your maths...)

### Numerical Optimizations

Consider the function f(x, y) = (x^2-8x+7)/(3) + (y^2-5x+8)/(6).

1. Analytically (with pen and paper!), calculate the gradient **vector** in terms of x and y
2. Use matplotlib to plot this function as a 2-D **surface** and get a feel for where its minimum value is (google for how to do this, and move on to the next steps/return later if you get stuck on this)
3. Pick a random starting point (x, y) and calculate f
4. Pick a learning rate
5. Write code that starts at your starting point (x, y), then moves by your learning rate in the direction opposite the gradient (by plugging x and y into your calculated gradient)
6. Repeat until convergence and the minimum is found.

How do you know when the minimum is found aka when to stop?  Up to you.
