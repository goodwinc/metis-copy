When John was a little kid he didn’t have much to do. So he evaluated the beauty of strings.

Given a string s, little Johnny defined the beauty of the string as the sum of the beauty of the letters in it.

The beauty of each letter is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive, and no two letters have the same beauty. Johnny doesn’t care about whether letters are uppercase or lowercase, so that doesn’t affect the beauty of a letter.

Given a string, what is the maximum possible score it could have?
