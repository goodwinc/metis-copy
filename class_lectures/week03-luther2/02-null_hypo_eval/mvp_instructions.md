## Luther MVP


### Objectives:

 * Selecting and presenting small findings from data projects
 * Battling our demons of perfectionism
 * Showing "something" to the client/project manager/etc.
 * Getting motivated to stay organized
 * Checking in on progress
 * Iterative design


### Instructions:

 * Select a very small number of plots (1 or 2 sounds perfect, let's say no more than 5 if you have a really slick/quick narrative that connects them all) from your movies project.
 * Pull out the plots, give them concise captions/context, and push them. There is an [example](mvp_example.md). (You could also make a tidy Jupyter notebook and push that. Just keep it very simple.)
 * Be ready to present the plots, extremely briefly. Think about the "story" and the "model" that you used, so you can speak effectively with different audiences.


# Don't overthink it.

Just show us something. Hopefully, you are looking *backwards* at things you have already done, picking something, sticking it up on GitHub, and then moving forward with whatever you are working on.
