### Administrivia

Welcome to the Metis Data Science Bootcamp!

You are all part of a Data Science Team now. Like any other good Data
Science Team, each of you have different strengths and weaknesses. If
you feel overwhelmed at any point, don't worry. Trust in the
admissions; you are here because you are capable of learning quickly,
and you have the grit, curiosity, and determination to become data
scientists.

We make every effort to foster a welcoming, collaborative environment,
so we hope that you will all work together and learn from each other.

Because of the diversity in your technical backgrounds, it's important
that we tailor the bootcamp. To that end, the syllabus is living and
breathing. To be able to shift pieces around and make it best meet
your needs, we need your feedback. We encourage you to continually let
us know about your experience.

Data Science is a very wide ranging field. No data scientist is an
expert in everything, and that's why we work in teams. In some
subjects, it is entirely possible that you may be the most
knowledgeable person in the room, including your instructors It is also
possible that you may be the least knowledgeable. But by the end of the
bootcamp, you will have a solid foundation. Most importantly, you'll
be experienced in the entire data science process from start to
finish, capable of quickly learning new tools and techniques, and you
will have a portfolio of projects to showcase your skills.

### Policies in Brief

For a full description of class policies, please consult the Student
Catalog.

We'll go over some policies on Day 1.


### Class Structure

#### Projects

- The bootcamp is project based. The projects are opportunities for
   you to apply what you've learned to build a portfolio for yourself.

- There will be 5 projects in total. Deliverables vary between
  projects; they may include blog posts, presentations, dashboards,
  apps, etc.

- Completion of deliverables for all projects is required. We'll 
  give you detailed individual feedback throughout.

- On any given week, there will always be a project that
  you'll be working on.

- Some projects are to be done in groups, some
  individually. Always, the instructors and teaching assistants are here
  to work with you and help you complete these projects.

- The first few projects are guided and more directed. As
  the course progresses, you'll have increasing freedom
  and autonomy with the projects. The final project
  (during Kojak) will be completely your design.


#### Lectures

- We'll have lecture in the mornings, and sometimes lecture will extend into the afternoon.

- We'll post slides and/or iPython notebooks after each lecture.

#### Challenge Problems

- We'll also have sets of challenges to help you learn the lecture
  material.

- Your instructors and teaching assistants will answer questions, pair
  program with you, and otherwise help you learn the material.

- You'll submit your solutions to the Challenges to our private
  Github repo.

- They aren't graded, but we'll give you feedback.


### Communication Tools

- We use [Slack][1] for quick and/or informal chat messages. 


- [Github][3] for Challenge and Project submissions


### Careers

The job search is an integral part of the bootcamp experience (if you
want a job). The entire Metis team is here to help. In particular,
Lillian and Megan will be there to help you during every step of the
process. They will schedule meetings with you both as a class and
individually, but you can also go to them for additional guidance. We
strongly encourage you to take advantage of this resource.
