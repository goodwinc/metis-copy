         * Setup caching of your Git credentials. 
            * For [Linux](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-linux), type `git config --global credential.helper cache`. This is not enabled by default on most distributions.
            * For [Mac](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-mac), the setting should be enabled by default; however, if you have issues with your password being remembered, execute `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain`.
